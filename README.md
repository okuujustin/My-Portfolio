Cleaning a dataset is one of the things I enjoyed doing as an analyst because it confirms that analysis can be performed without glitches. So, the essence of this project is to clean this dataset and get it ready for analysis, and create a detailed report thereafter.

I decided to tell a story about my finances last year as a data analyst.
One of my decisions last year was to keep a record of all my cash flow. I tried many times and failed. I decided to learn and grow through the process. Today, I am happy that I have become conscious about putting down all my financial activities, no matter how small. With this, I have saved myself from illicit and unnecessary spending.

This project shows the rate of infection increase globally, the death rate, and also the intervention of vaccines.
